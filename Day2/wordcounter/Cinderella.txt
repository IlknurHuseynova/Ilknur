Cinderella
Once there lived a poor servant girl.
Her days were long and grueling—filled with the most tiresome and tedious chores.
Scrubbing floors. Washing clothes. Dusting shelves. And cooking meals.
She was made to work from dawn until dusk without a single penny in return for her long-suffering hardship.
It was the most terrible injustice.
You see, her mother had died and her father soon remarried. But his new wife was a simply wretched woman. And she had—from a previous marriage—two equally wretched daughters of her own.
They would tease the poor girl dreadfully each day. And one day, while she swept the cinders from the fire, they taunted her and chanted,
“Cinders… cinders… sweep sweep sweep,In those rags in which you sleep,From this day your name will be,Cinderella… hee… hee… hee!’”
And—sure enough—from that day forward the servant girl’s real name was forgotten and she became known across the land as Cinderella.
